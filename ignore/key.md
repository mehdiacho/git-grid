5. Facilitates communication between developers, analysts, and stakeholders, ensuring smooth project execution.
6. Supports future modifications and upgrades, making the system adaptable to new requirements.

### Additional Information from Slides:
- **Planning**: Identify system needs and define project goals. Conduct feasibility studies and develop project schedules.
- **Analysis**: Gather detailed user requirements. Define functional and non-functional requirements. Use tools like Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) and Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD).
- **Design**: Create system architecture, database design, and user interfaces. Define system components and data structures. Develop technical specifications for developers.
- **Implementation**: Convert system design into actual code. Use programming languages, frameworks, and databases. Perform initial testing.
- **Testing**: Validate that the system meets business and technical requirements. Conduct functional, performance, and security testing. Fix bugs and optimize system performance.
- **Deployment**: Install the system for users. Train end-users and provide documentation. Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT).
- **Maintenance & Support**: Monitor system performance. Fix issues and apply updates. Improve system functionality based on feedback.

## Question 4: Differentiate between functional and non-functional requirements in system analysis.

### Original Answer:
Functional requirements define what a system should do, specifying its features, operations, and interactions. These include tasks such as user authentication, data processing, and report generation, which describe the system's core functionalities. On the other hand, non-functional requirements focus on how the system should perform, addressing aspects like performance, security, usability, and scalability. These requirements ensure that the system is efficient, secure, and user-friendly. For example, while a functional requirement may state that a system should allow users to log in, a non-functional requirement would specify that the login process should not take more than two seconds. Both types of requirements are essential in system analysis to ensure that the final system is both functional and efficient.

### Additional Information from Slides:
- **Functional Requirements**: Define what a system should do, specifying its features, operations, and interactions.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Focus on how the system should perform, addressing aspects like performance, security, usability, and scalability.

## Question 5: What are the key features of Rapid Application Development (RAD)?

### Original Answer:
1. Prototyping: RAD emphasizes the creation of prototypes that allow users to visualize and test functionalities early in the development process. This helps in gathering feedback and making quick adjustments.
2. Iterative Development: The system is built in multiple iterations, allowing for continuous improvements based on user feedback and changing requirements.
3. User Involvement: End-users are actively involved throughout the development process to ensure the final system meets their needs and expectations.
4. Component Reusability: RAD encourages the reuse of existing components and modules, reducing development time and costs.
5. Faster Development: By using pre-built components, automated tools, and continuous feedback, RAD significantly reduces the time required to develop a system compared to traditional methods.
6. Flexible and Adaptive Process: RAD allows developers to adapt to changing requirements without major disruptions, making it suitable for dynamic business environments.
7. Minimal Documentation: Unlike traditional development models, RAD focuses more on working prototypes and direct communication rather than extensive documentation.

### Additional Information from Slides:

## Question 6: Describe the process of Value Stream Mapping and its purpose in business process analysis.

### Original Answer:
Value Stream Mapping is a visual tool used in business process analysis to identify inefficiencies, eliminate waste, and improve workflow. The process involves several key steps:
1. Identify the Process: Define the specific business process to be analyzed, such as product manufacturing or service delivery.
2. Map the Current State: Create a visual representation of the existing workflow, including inputs, outputs, delays, and bottlenecks.
3. Analyze the Process: Identify non-value-adding activities, redundancies, and inefficiencies that slow down operations.
4. Design the Future State: Develop an optimized version of the process with streamlined steps, improved efficiency, and reduced waste.
5. Implement and Monitor: Apply the new process changes, track performance, and make continuous improvements as needed.

**Purpose:**
The main goal of VSM is to enhance efficiency, reduce waste, and improve overall productivity in an organization. It helps businesses visualize workflows, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions for process improvement.

### Additional Information from Slides:
- **Value Stream Mapping**: A Value Stream Map displays the high-level process steps along with key process data. Analyzes the flow of materials and information through a business process.
- **Purpose**: Identifies value-adding and non-value-adding steps to optimize efficiency.

## Question 7: What are the key elements of Structured Analysis (SA)? Explain how it differs from Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA).

### Original Answer:
Structured Analysis (SA) focuses on breaking down a system into processes and data flow to understand how it functions. The key elements of SA include Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), which visually represent how data moves through a system; Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), which define relationships between different data entities; process descriptions that document the functionality of system processes; a data dictionary that defines data elements and their relationships; and structured charts that provide a hierarchical breakdown of system modules. These tools help to map the system's structure and flow, making it easier to analyze and design.

In contrast, Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) takes a different approach by focusing on objects—real-world entities that encapsulate data and behaviors. OOA uses classes and objects, where each object has attributes (data) and methods (behaviors), and interactions between these objects define the system's behavior. The main difference between SA and OOA is that SA centers around processes and data flow, whereas OOA emphasizes the modeling of real-world objects and their interactions. OOA tends to be more modular, reusable, and adaptable to changes, which makes it more suited for complex systems that require a flexible and scalable design.

### Additional Information from Slides:
- **Structured Analysis (SA)**:
  - **Decomposition**: Breaking a system or problem into smaller parts to analyze them independently.
  - **Modeling Techniques**: Using diagrams and structured methods to represent data and processes.
  - **Top-Down Approach**: Starting with a high-level overview before refining details.
  - **Data Flow Analysis**: Identifying how data moves through a system.
  - **Common Techniques**: Data Flow Diagrams (DFD), Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), Decision Trees and Tables, Structured English (Pseudocode), State Transition Diagrams.

- **Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA)**:
  - Focuses on objects and interactions: Uses classes, attributes, and methods to model the system.
  - Encapsulates both data and behavior: Unlike SA, which treats them separately.
  - Uses Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams: Such as class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and use-case diagrams.
  - Better suited for modern programming languages: Works well with Java, Python, and C++.
